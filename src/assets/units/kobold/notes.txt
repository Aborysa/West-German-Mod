Light Tank ODF still needs some editing, weapon hardpoints, scrap values, sounds, etc.

To test the Kobold, copy wvltnk into addon folder. Then copy avrecy from the testing folder into addon. Then you can test the Kobold (built from recy) in singleplayer.

The wvltnk folder that is not in the Version folder is the most current version.

The Kobold’s collision box has been replaced with Goomba’s version and is therefor finished. Do not mess with the VDF
